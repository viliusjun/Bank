Process 1: Customers come to the bank and turn to any available cashier, if all the cashiers are busy, the customers join the general queue, but there are VIP customers who are served without a queue, of course, if all the cashiers are occupied, the VIP customers also have to wait, a VIP queue may even form.
Process 2: the bank has separate cashiers, who work with regular and VIP clients.
